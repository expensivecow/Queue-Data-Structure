TEST FRAMEWORK:

For each function:

1. empty()
2. size()
3. push()
4. pop()
5. peek()

When empty is implemented:

1. [] (empty array) should output true
2. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output false

When size() is implemented add the following test cases:

3. [] (empty array) should output 0
4. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output 7

When push() is implemented:

5. [] push (empty array) 8 should be [8]

When pop() is implemented:

6. popping on [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] should output 8
7. popping [] (empty array) should output 0 and print out that its an exception

When peek() is implemented add the following test cases:

8. [] should output 0 and print on screen that the stack is empty;
9. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output 4
